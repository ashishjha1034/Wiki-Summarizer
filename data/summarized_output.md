This boarding school-like setting allowed Alexander to develop friendships with future generals, known as the "Companions," who included Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Alexander's education also exposed him to Persian culture and politics, as he interacted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, including Artabazos II and Barsine. Under Aristotle's guidance, Alexander developed a passion for literature, particularly Homer's works, and was able to quote Euripides from memory.

### King of Macedon > Destruction of Thebes

Alexander turned south to quell a rebellion by Thebans and Athenians, but Thebes chose to fight and was ultimately defeated.

Alexander then departed for his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent in his place.

### Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire > Strategy

Alexander's invasion of Persia is considered a prime example of a "strategic line" in warfare, where operations are connected to form a cohesive whole. To achieve this, Alexander secured his base in Greece, conquered the Balkans, and eliminated his opponents. He then secured his army's rear by conquering the Afro-Asian coastline, where the Persian fleet was based. This strategic approach allowed Alexander to resolve the challenge of operating deep within enemy territory.

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

During Alexander's campaign in Asia, he left Antipater in charge of Macedon, who maintained peace and stability in Greece, except for a brief rebellion by the Spartans in 331 BC. Antipater defeated and killed the Spartan king Agis III, but Alexander chose to pardon the Spartans. Alexander's conquests brought economic prosperity to Greece, with vast sums of wealth being sent back and stimulating trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians weakened the region, ultimately leading to its subjugation by Rome after Alexander's death.

### Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire > Coinage

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Philip II's conquests of Pangaeum and Thasos brought rich gold and silver mines under Macedonian control. Alexander introduced a new coinage in Cilicia after the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, featuring gold and silver coins with various designs, including the head of Athena and Zeus. The coinage designs reflected both Greek and non-Greek influences, with Heracles and Zeus being important deities for the Macedonians. Alexander did not impose a uniform imperial coinage, allowing Persian coins to continue circulating in the satrapies of his empire.

### Indian campaign > Revolt of the Hellenic army

Here's a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Alexander's army, exhausted from years of campaigning, mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas) and refused to march farther east into India. The Macedonians' struggle with Porus had blunted their courage, and they opposed Alexander's plan to cross the Ganges River due to the massive forces awaiting them. Alexander eventually agreed to turn south and march along the Indus, conquering the Malhi and other Indian tribes, but suffered a near-fatal injury during the siege of the Mallian citadel. He then led a portion of his army back to Persia through the Gedrosian Desert, while sending others to Carmania and commissioning a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore.

## Last years in Persia

Upon his return to Persia, Alexander executed several of his satraps who had misbehaved in his absence and paid off the debts of his soldiers. However, his troops mutinied at Opis, criticizing his adoption of Persian customs and the introduction of Persian officers into Macedonian units. Alexander eventually placated his men by giving Persians command posts and conferring Macedonian titles on Persian units, and he attempted to foster harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects through a mass marriage of his officers to noblewomen. After dealing with the mutiny and a personal loss, Alexander continued his campaign, planning new expeditions, including an invasion of Arabia, and honoring the memory of his friend Hephaestion.

### Death and succession > Post-death events

Here's a summary of the text in 4 concise sentences:

Alexander's body was initially laid to rest in a gold casket, but it was later seized by Ptolemy and taken to Memphis, then eventually transferred to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late antiquity. The tomb in Alexandria was visited by several Roman emperors, including Augustus, who allegedly damaged Alexander's mummified body, and Caracalla, who was a great admirer of Alexander. The "Alexander Sarcophagus" discovered near Sidon is not believed to be the actual sarcophagus of Alexander, but rather a separate artifact depicting Alexander and his companions. After Alexander's death, his army was likened to the blinded Cyclops, symbolizing the disorder and anarchy that ensued among his generals.

### Death and succession > Last plans

Alexander the Great left behind written instructions, known as his "last plans," which outlined his vision for future military expansion, monumental constructions, and cultural exchange between East and West. However, his successors chose not to implement these plans, deeming them impractical and extravagant. The historicity of these plans is disputed among scholars, with some arguing they were exaggerated or invented to justify the successors' actions. The true nature and authenticity of Alexander's "last plans" remain uncertain.

### Character > Generalship

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Alexander the Great earned his epithet due to his unparalleled success as a military commander, never losing a battle despite often being outnumbered. He utilized the Macedonian phalanx, a formation of long spears, in combination with cavalry and bold strategy to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander adapted his tactics to suit the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents, employing different formations and using his cavalry and archers to counter unfamiliar fighting techniques. His ability to lead from the front and inspire loyalty in his troops was a key factor in his military successes, which included victories at Granicus, Issus, and Gaugamela.

### Character > Personality

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Alexander's parents, Philip and Olympias, encouraged his ambitions and instilled in him a sense of destiny, with his father serving as a role model and his mother emphasizing the need to conquer the Persian Empire. Alexander had a complex personality, combining a competitive and impulsive nature with a desire for knowledge, a love of philosophy, and a rational side that allowed him to succeed as a general. As he grew older, Alexander's behavior became increasingly erratic, exhibiting signs of megalomania and paranoia, but this may have been a calculated attempt to strengthen his rule and unite his culturally diverse empire. Ultimately, Alexander's unique abilities and charisma made him a great leader, but his death left a power vacuum that none of his generals could fill.

### Character > Personal relationships

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Alexander the Great married three times: once for love to Roxana, and twice for political reasons to Persian princesses Stateira and Parysatis. He had two confirmed children with Roxana, including Alexander IV of Macedon, and possibly an illegitimate son, Heracles, with a mistress named Barsine. Alexander was also close to his friend and general, Hephaestion, whose death had a profound impact on him. Hephaestion's death may have contributed to Alexander's declining mental and physical health during his final months.

## Legacy

Alexander's reign marked a significant turning point in European and Asian history, increasing contacts and trade between East and West. His campaigns exposed vast areas to Greek civilization and influence, leading to the establishment of major cultural centers that survived into the 21st century. As a result, the Greeks gained a sense of belonging to a broader world beyond the Mediterranean. His legacy had a lasting impact on the regions he conquered.

### Legacy > Hellenistic kingdoms

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Alexander's empire, which covered 5,200,000 km2 at the time of his death, introduced Macedonian rule to vast areas of Asia and had a lasting impact on the region. The empire's successor states, which emerged after Alexander's death, dominated the area for 200-300 years, marking the Hellenistic period. The power vacuum left by Alexander's empire in the northwest Indian subcontinent led to the rise of the powerful Maurya Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya. Chandragupta Maurya, of humble origin, conquered the Punjab and eventually the Nanda Empire, establishing a significant Indian dynasty.

### Legacy > Founding of cities

Alexander the Great founded numerous cities named Alexandria, primarily east of the Tigris, to facilitate trade and secure defensive positions. The most notable of these was Alexandria in Egypt, which became a prominent Mediterranean city. Initially, the cities were likely small and inhospitable, but they eventually flourished, attracting both Greek and local populations, and developing into thriving urban centers.

### Legacy > Funding of temples

Here's a summary of the text in 3 concise sentences:

Alexander the Great donated funds to complete the temple of Athena Polias in Priene, Turkey, in 334 BC, as confirmed by an inscription in the British Museum. He also founded other temples, including the temple of Zeus Bottiaios in the area where Antioch was later built, and a temple to Sarapis. Recent discoveries suggest that Alexander may have also founded a Greek temple at Girsu in Iraq, honoring Zeus and his divine sons, Heracles and Alexander.

### Legacy > Influence on Rome

Here is a 4-sentence summary of the text:

Many Roman leaders, including Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Caracalla, admired Alexander the Great and sought to associate themselves with his achievements, often by adopting his style, symbols, or tactics. However, some Roman writers used Alexander as a cautionary tale about the dangers of autocratic tendencies and the importance of Roman values such as friendship, clemency, and moderation. Alexander's legacy extended beyond Roman politics, with his conquests facilitating the diffusion of Greek culture and language, which in turn paved the way for Roman expansion into West Asia and North Africa. Roman emperors, including Caligula and Caracalla, often imitated Alexander's military tactics and personal style, with some even going so far as to claim to be the "new Alexander."

### Legacy > Letters

Alexander the Great's original letters have not survived, but copies of official letters to Greek cities are inscribed in stone. Some historical sources report the content of his letters, but these quotes are often unreliable. Fictitious letters, possibly based on real ones, also exist within the Romance tradition.

### Legacy > In legend

Here is a summary of the text in 3 concise sentences:

Many of the legends about Alexander the Great originated during his lifetime, possibly encouraged by Alexander himself. After his death, stories about him continued to evolve, with some being invented by court historians like Onesicritus, who wrote about a romantic encounter between Alexander and the queen of the Amazons. These legends eventually coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, which underwent numerous translations and adaptations across the Islamic and European worlds.

## Historiography

Most contemporary accounts of Alexander the Great's life were lost, but later historians used original sources to write their own accounts. The earliest surviving works include Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) and Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st century AD), followed by Arrian, Plutarch, and Justin. Arrian is considered the most reliable source, as he used primary sources Ptolemy and Aristobulus in his writing.
